	1.1 - Course Intro
		3 main models we will look at
			Descriptive - What do neurons respond to?
			Mechanistic - How can we simulate?
			Interpretive - Why / Underlying principles?
	1.2 - Descriptive Models
		Receptive fields - sensory stimulus that generates strong response
			Center-surround response
		Cortical receptive fields
			Can be orientation specific
	1.3 - Mechanistic and Interpretive Models
		Retina -> Lateral Geniculate Nucleaus (LGN) -> Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
			Recurrent inputs to V1 cell as well as inputs from a pattern of LGN
		Cortical receptive fields are a way of efficiently compressing information in a natural image
	1.4 - Electrical Personality of Neurons
		Neuron
			25 um cell body
			dendrites - inputs
			axon - output
				myelin sheaths - action potential hops from node of Ranvier to node of Ranvier
					"active wire" lossless propagation
			lots of kinds of neurons
			"discrete and not continuous with other cells"
				largely true
			leaky bag of charged liquid
				lipid bilayer makes membrane
					ion channel in bilayer
						voltage gated
						chemically gated
						mechanically gated
				inside is ~-70mV relative to outside of cell
				Na, Cl, H20, K molecules and ions are major constituents
			synapse - interface between axon and cell body
	1.5 - Making Connections: Synapses
		Electrical synapse - gap junctions
			like a semiconductor
			fast connections
		Chemical synapse - neurotransmitters
			can have "weighting" in these synapses by augmenting number of receptors on receiving cell
		Can be excitatory or inhibitory
		Thought to be the basis for memory and learning
			Synaptic PLasticity
				Hebbian plasticity
					Neurons that fire together, wire together
					Long term potentiation/depression - synaptic response can stay for hours or days
