	1.1 - Course Intro
		3 main models we will look at
			Descriptive - What do neurons respond to?
			Mechanistic - How can we simulate?
			Interpretive - Why / Underlying principles?
	1.2 - Descriptive Models
		Receptive fields - sensory stimulus that generates strong response
			Center-surround response
		Cortical receptive fields
			Can be orientation specific
	1.3 - Mechanistic and Interpretive Models
		Retina -> Lateral Geniculate Nucleaus (LGN) -> Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
			Recurrent inputs to V1 cell as well as inputs from a pattern of LGN
		Cortical receptive fields are a way of efficiently compressing information in a natural image
	1.4 - Electrical Personality of Neurons
		Neuron
			25 um cell body
			dendrites - inputs
			axon - output
				myelin sheaths - action potential hops from node of Ranvier to node of Ranvier
					"active wire" lossless propagation
			lots of kinds of neurons
			"discrete and not continuous with other cells"
				largely true
			leaky bag of charged liquid
				lipid bilayer makes membrane
					ion channel in bilayer
						voltage gated
						chemically gated
						mechanically gated
				inside is ~-70mV relative to outside of cell
				Na, Cl, H20, K molecules and ions are major constituents
			synapse - interface between axon and cell body
	1.5 - Making Connections: Synapses
		Electrical synapse - gap junctions
			like a semiconductor
			fast connections
		Chemical synapse - neurotransmitters
			can have "weighting" in these synapses by augmenting number of receptors on receiving cell
		Can be excitatory or inhibitory
		Thought to be the basis for memory and learning
			Synaptic PLasticity
				Hebbian plasticity
					Neurons that fire together, wire together
					Long term potentiation/depression - synaptic response can stay for hours or days 
						Input/output spike timing
	1.6 Network: Brain Areas and their Function
		Peripheral Nervous System
			Somatic - nerves connected to muscles and sensory receptors
				Afferent nerve fibers - inward
				Efferent nerve fibers - outward
			Autonomic - subconscious
		Central Nervous System 
			Spinal cord
				Local feedback - reflexes
				Descending motor control
				Ascending sensory axons
			Brain
				hindbrain
					medulla oblongata - regulates breathing etc
					pons - sleep+arousal
					cerebellum - timing voluntary movements, language, attention
				midbrain - sensory reflexes
				reticular formation - regulates
				thalamus - "relay station" for sensory
				hypothalamus - four Fs
				cerebrum
					 cerebral cortex - big dawg
					 	layered sheet of neurons
					 	30b neurons
					 	10k connections each
					 	300t total connections
					 basal ganglia
					 hippocampus
					 amygdala 
		Analogies
			Information storage - physical/chemical structure
			Information transmisison - Electrical/chemical signalling
			Primary compute element - neuron
			Computational basis - unknown
