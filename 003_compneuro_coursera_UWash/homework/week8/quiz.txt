1. Which is true during training?
unsupervised - inputs provided
Supervised - correct outputs
Supervised - inputs provided

2. What will lead to + output of perceptron with weights [1 3] and threshold 0?
[-1 1]
[1 1]

3. What happens if perceptron misclassifies? u3 = -1 and v = +1, should be -1.
w3 should increase
threshold increase

4. Training might never converge. What can we do to make sure it converges?
Reduce training rate

5. Most appropriate for: Training chess AI without expert feedback
Supervised

6. Most appropriate for: Robot learning to manipulate with regular feedback
Reinforcement

7. Most appropriate for: Disease outbreak with only map data. Try to cluster
Unsupervised

8. Most appropriate for: Feature discovery in unlabeled images
Unsupervised

9. Most appropriate for: Correlation between input and output with labels?
Supervised

10. Most appropriate for: Classifying labeled cars
Supervised

11. Maze?
v(C) = 1, v(B) = 0.8*2.5 + 0.2*1 = 2.2

12. How do we give a penalty proportional to amount of time taken?
R to negative constant for all states
R to neg constant for states + actions

13. Don't penalize for resting
Exclude resting for penalty
