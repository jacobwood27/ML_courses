For this particular quiz, be sure to fill in values for sampling_period and num_timesteps in quiz2.m (quiz.py if you're using Python) and num_spikes in compute_sta.m (compute_sta.py).

Run the code by simply typing quiz2 in the command window (in both Matlab and Octave). If you're using the Python code instead, open quiz2.py in the editor and select Run (or hit F5).

Lastly, if you are struggling with Matlab/Octave/Python at all be sure to check out the tutorials posted in the Matlab and Octave Information page or the Python Information page in this week's Reading section for some tips.
